# Homebrew formula TEMPLATE for the rayforcedb/tap tap.
#
# release.yml substitutes https://github.com/RayforceDB/rayforce/archive/refs/tags/v2.1.7.tar.gz and e0febb0df892c08e31210b309994b4c2505d5f63e0051f470e060318203b651c (the GitHub source tarball for
# the tag and its sha256) and pushes the result to RayforceDB/homebrew-tap as
# Formula/rayforce.rb on every release.
#
# Build-from-source on purpose: it compiles for the user's own CPU (so it works
# on every Mac arch and never SIGILLs the way a redistributed -march=native
# binary can), and a zero-dependency `make` build needs no `depends_on`.
